Perun
-----

`Perun <https://perun-aai.org/>`_ is the main "database" of the service where all
important data are stored and retrieved. de.NBI projects are stored as groups with
attributes and individual locations (Bielefeld, Gie√üen,...) are partly modeled as
Resources. Groups and Attributes are implemented in the :mod:`os_credits.perun` module,
resources are not since we are only interested in their ID's.

Groups
^^^^^^

Most of the attributes are directly assigned to groups but there also ones which are
assigned to a connection between a group and a resource (a group assigned to a
resource). We call this attributes *resource bound*. One example is
:class:`~os_credits.perun.attributes.DenbiCreditTimestamps`.

Attributes
