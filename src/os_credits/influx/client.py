"""This module contains our :class:`InfluxDBClient` which is a subclass of the one
provided by the ``aioinflux`` package.

Ours does not rewrite any functionality, it only contains additional functions to ease
writing and querying our custom data models which are all based on
:class:`~os_credits.influx.model.InfluxDBPoint`.

When querying :class:`~collections.abc.AsyncGenerator` are used whenever possible, to
prevent excessive loading data when only e.g. the last 5 entries are needed.
